# Car-Detection-using-Yolo

### Problem Statement

You are working on a self-driving car. As a critical component of this project, you'd like to first build a car detection system. To collect data, you've mounted a camera to the hood (meaning the front) of the car, which takes pictures of the road ahead every few seconds as you drive around.

I have used keras pretrained model Yolo V2
